# Node.js Performance Tips

Node.js is fast, but you can make it faster. Here are my top performance optimization techniques.

## 1. Use Async/Await Properly

Don't block the event loop. Use async/await for I/O operations and keep CPU-intensive tasks in worker threads.

## 2. Connection Pooling

Always use connection pooling for databases. Creating new connections is expensive.

\`\`\`typescript
const pool = new Pool({
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
\`\`\`

## 3. Caching Strategy

Implement multi-layer caching: in-memory, Redis, and CDN.

## 4. Monitoring

Use APM tools like New Relic or DataDog. You can't optimize what you don't measure.

Stay fast!
