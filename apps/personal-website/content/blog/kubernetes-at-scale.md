# Scaling Kubernetes: Lessons Learned

After managing Kubernetes clusters serving thousands of users, here are the key lessons I've learned about scaling container orchestration.

## 1. Resource Limits Are Not Optional

Always set resource requests and limits. Always. Your future self will thank you when debugging OOMKilled pods at 3 AM.

\`\`\`yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
\`\`\`

## 2. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

HPA is your friend, but configure it wisely. Start conservative and tune based on actual metrics.

## 3. Network Policies Matter

Don't leave your cluster wide open. Implement network policies from day one.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is powerful but complex. Start simple, monitor everything, and scale gradually.
